= Lilith

A Lisp interpreter.

== Build Lilith
Both Linux and Mac OS are supported.

The Lilith REPL has a dependency on the `editline` library.
Many platforms (Mac OS) have this installed as standard but if not it will be available through your package manager.
E.g. on Ubuntu,

 $ sudo apt install libedit-dev

There are a couple of additional dependencies on my own libraries which are also available on Github.
`simplified-make` keeps Lilith's makefiles simple and `collections` provides a hash table implementation. Both are referenced here as submodules so clone Lilith with this command,

 $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/akwilson/lilith.git

From there just build the project,

 $ make

Or build and run the automated tests,

 $ make tests

and run the Lilith REPL with,

 $ src/build/lilith
