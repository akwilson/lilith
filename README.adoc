= Lilith Lisp

A Lisp interpreter.

== Build Lilith
Both Linux and Mac OS are supported.

Lilith has a dependency on the `editline` library.
Many platforms (Mac OS) have this installed as standard but if not it will be available through your package manager.
E.g. on Ubuntu

 $ sudo apt install libedit-dev

Lilith's makefiles use my own make package, `simplified-make` which is also available on Github. From the root directory of the project run,

 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update

From there just make the project.

 $ make
